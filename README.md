# ml-iris
A play around with machine learning and the iris data set to predict flower types based on dimensions alone.

To use you must have python 3 and tensorflow installed

You can re-run the normaliser but I have included the normalised data so you don't have to do anything, but just run the `brain.py`.

You should get around 90%+ accuracy.

Enjoy!
